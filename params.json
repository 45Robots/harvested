For example, HTTP Timeouts, Occasional Bad Gateways, and Rate Limiting issues need to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nUsing `Harvested#client` your code needs to handle all these situations. However you can also use `Harvested#hardy_client` which will retry errors and wait for Rate Limit resets.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nharvest = Harvest.hardy_client('yoursubdomain', 'yourusername', 'yourpassword')\r\nharvest.projects.all   # This will wait for the Rate Limit reset if you have gone over your limit\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Ruby support\r\n\r\nHarvested's tests are currently passing for 1.8.7, 1.9.2, JRuby 1.6.2, and Rubinius\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Harvested Documentation](http://rdoc.info/projects/zmoazeni/harvested)\r\n* [Harvest API Documentation](http://www.getharvest.com/api)\r\n* [Source Code for Harvested](http://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested)\r\n\r\n## Who are you? ##\r\n\r\nMy name is [Zach Moazeni](https://twitter.com/zmoazeni).

Check the GitHub issue tracker to see if anyone else has had the same issue.\r\nhttp://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested/issues/\r\n2. If you donâ€™t see anything, create an issue with information on how to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute an enhancement or a fix:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the project on github http://github.com/zmoazeni/harvested\r\n2. Make your changes with tests\r\n3. Commit the changes without messing with the Rakefile, VERSION, or history\r\n4. Send me a pull request\r\n\r\nNote on running tests: most specs run against a live Harvest account. To run the suite, sign up for a free trial account and fill out `/spec/support/harvest_credentials.yml` *(a sample harvest_credentials.example.yml has been included)*.\r\n\r\n**DO NOT USE YOUR NORMAL CREDENTIALS IN `/spec/support/harvest_credentials.yml`!!!** The test suite blasts all the data before running (similiar to DatabaseCleaner).\r\n\r\nThe tests use [VCR](https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr) to cache the API responses. This is a great boon for running the tests offline. While uncommon, sometimes the Harvest API will send an erroneous response, VCR will cache it, and subsequent runs will use the incorrect cached response. In order to clear the cached responses, you can run the specs with the `VCR_REFRESH` environmental variable set to true (e.g. `VCR_REFRESH=true bundle exec rake spec`).\r\n\r\nUsing [rvm](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) you can run the tests against the popular ruby runtimes by running:\r\n\r\n  ./spec/test_rubies\r\n\r\nEach runtime needs to be installed in rvm along with the bundler gem.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* Write Documentation\r\n* Allow Timer Toggling\r\n\r\n## Notes on Harvest Estimates\r\n\r\nEstimates aren't currently supported due to lack of an API. If this opens up, harvested will include them.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40227412-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
